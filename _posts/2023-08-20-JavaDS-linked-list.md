# Linked Lists
Linked lists are a very powerful and versatile sequential data structure. While traditional lists store their information in contiguous blocks of memory. Linked lists are more flexible. Each element in a linked list contains a value, and a reference to the next item in the list. This implementation comes with a combination of advantages and setbacks.

| Advantages | Setbacks |
|-|-|
| Faster insertion and deletion speed | Slower traversal speed |
| Dynammic size (can grow and shrink freely) | More memory  to store the reference to next element |
| Flexible storage in memory | Reverse traversing not possible in a **Singly Linked-List** |
| Minimal wasted memory (Everything is preallocated) | No random access is possible |

## Singly Linked-List
As the name suggests, a singly linked-list implies a single connection from one node to the next. In order words, the list can only go in one direction.
