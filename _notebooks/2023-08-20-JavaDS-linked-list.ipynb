    "# Linked Lists\n",
    "Linked lists are a very powerful and versatile sequential data structure. While traditional lists store their information in contiguous blocks of memory. Linked lists are more flexible. Each element in a linked list contains a value, and a reference to the next item in the list. This implementation comes with a combination of advantages and setbacks.\n",

    "| Faster insertion and deletion speed | Slower traversal speed |\n",
    "| Dynammic size (can grow and shrink freely) | More memory  to store the reference to next element |\n",
